    <strong>
      Time and Material model to deliver your project in the best way possible

    </strong>
  </h2>

  
    
      <p>When you are going to launch a long-lasting project but you do not know all the details and it is difficult to estimate them in advance we offer you a way out. At Logic IT Solutions we have dealt with similar projects many times and the best option, in this case, is Time and Material model.</p>

    
  
    
      <p>According to Time and Material, model client reimburses the costs for hours of development, for material and other additional charges, for example, business trips. In contrast to Fixed Price per Project model, this type of cooperation does not require precise calculation of all the aspects.</p>

    
  
    
      <p>This model is a perfect choice for long-term cooperation. During the meetings with the client,  the team of developers provides information about the hours spent on the realization of each function and the progress made in the development. The distinctive feature of Logic IT Solutions is flexibility because we are always ready to implement your corrections in the process of development and to focus on that aspect that is important for you.</p>
